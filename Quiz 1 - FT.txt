QUIZ # 1 - FINAL TERM

Observations:
•	I noticed or observed that the LED in the motherboard lights up once the system is connected
•	The fan in the power supply and motherboard works well for a few seconds and then stops working after a while.
•	And the monitor displays ‘Power Saver  Mode is On’ while the fan is working, and turns off.
•	A certain capacitor is bloated in the power supply.


Possible Solution:
•	The fuse in the power supply needs to be replaced.
•	The bloated capacitor also needs replacing.
•	We think that the power supply has a problem, so it’s better for us to replace it with a functional power supply, with the same specifications.
•	If these possible solutions can’t change anything to make the system functional, better troubleshoot the motherboard and its parts.
